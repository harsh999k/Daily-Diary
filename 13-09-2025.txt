Task: Made the Components

Work: Today, I designed components for the first time in the KaamDhanda User app. These components help make the screens more interactive and can be reused in other screens to maintain consistency. I learned how components save time and make future design work easier. I used these components in the Rating screen and completed its design. This activity helped me understand the importance of reusable elements in UI design.
