Task: changes in Shop insider screen

Work: Today, I made changes to the Shop Insider screen based on the feedback given by my mentor. There were several alignment issues, which I carefully fixed to improve layout consistency and visual balance. I also redesigned the Sort and Filter bar and moved it to the bottom of the screen for easier access and better navigation. While making these changes, I focused on usability, accessibility, and clarity to improve the overall user experience.
