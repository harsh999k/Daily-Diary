Task: Make popups and interactions

Work: Today, I added pop-up screens in the KaamDhanda User app to display important alert and confirmation messages. These pop-ups help provide clear user feedback during actions such as confirmations, errors, or successful tasks. I also added interactions and animations using Figma Smart Animate to make the transitions smooth and natural. While designing the pop-ups i ensure that it can't break the flow
