Task: UX Principles

Work: Today, I studied UX principles to understand how we can make the user experience simple and comfortable. I learned how good UX helps users complete their tasks easily and keeps their journey smooth without breaking the flow. I focused on concepts like clear navigation, consistency, reducing user effort, and guiding users step by step. This study helped me understand how thoughtful design decisions improve usability and create a better overall experience for users.
