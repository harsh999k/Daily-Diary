Task: Learning new softwares

Work: Today, I started learning new software tools such as Framer and ProtoPie. I found Framer very interesting as it is a no-code website builder tool. I learned how websites can be designed and built without writing a single line of code by using visual components and interactions. This learning helped me understand how no-code tools can speed up the design process and allow designers to create functional websites more efficiently.
