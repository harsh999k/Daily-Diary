Task: Complete the wallet screen

Work: Today, I continued designing the Wallet screen of the KaamDhanda Partner app. I added colors, strokes, and other visual elements to the wallet cards to make the interface more clear and visually appealing. I also designed the Wallet Plan Details screen, where users can view complete information about their wallet plan. While working on these screens, I focused on visual hierarchy, clarity, and usability to ensure that important information is easy to understand and access.
