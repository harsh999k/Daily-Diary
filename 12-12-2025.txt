Task: Testing the latest apks

Work: Today, I tested both the latest APKs of the KaamDhanda apps. I analyzed the new features and recent improvements to understand how they affect the overall user experience. During testing, I identified a few bugs and issues related to functionality and usability. I documented these observations and shared them with my supervisor for further review and fixes. This testing helped improve app quality and reliability.
