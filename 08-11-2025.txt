Task: Payment interface screen

Work: Today, I designed the Payment Interface screen of the KaamDhanda User app. I also connected the Order Details, Coupon, and Cart screens to create a smooth and complete purchase flow for buying a product. While designing the payment interface, I focused on clarity, security cues, and minimal distractions to build user trust. I also ensured that payment options, total amount, and confirmation actions are clearly visible and easy to understand. This helped improve the overall checkout experience.
