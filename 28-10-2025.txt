Task: Product detail screen

Work: Today, I started designing the Product Details screen of the KaamDhanda User app. First, I analyzed how different companies present their products in mobile applications. I observed layouts, image placement, pricing details, and action buttons. Based on this analysis, I noted the key points required for a good product details screen and then created wireframes to structure the layout clearly. This approach helped me plan the screen efficiently before moving to the final design.
