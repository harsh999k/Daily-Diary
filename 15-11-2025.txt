Task: Make like us Screen and language selector

Work: Today, I designed the Like & Share screen of the KaamDhanda User app, allowing users to like and share the app easily with others. I also designed the Change Language bar, so users can switch between different languages comfortably. While designing these features, I focused on usability, accessibility, and clear actions, ensuring users can quickly understand and use these options without confusion.
