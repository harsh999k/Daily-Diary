Task: Compete the follower screen

Work: Today, I finished the design of the Follower screen of the KaamDhanda Partner app. I added filter options, an action button, and display cards to show follower information clearly. I also applied appropriate colors to maintain consistency with the app’s design system. While finalizing this screen, I focused on usability, visual hierarchy, and clarity, making it easy for shopkeepers to manage followers and perform actions efficiently.
