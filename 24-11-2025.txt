Task: Studying Figma advanced prototyping

Work: Today, I learned advanced prototyping features in Figma, which are used to create more interactive prototypes. I explored how to add complex interactions, animations, and transitions to simulate real app behavior. This learning helped me understand how advanced prototyping improves user testing and gives a more realistic experience of the final product.
