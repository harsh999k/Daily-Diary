Task: Complete the Home Screen

Work: Today, I completed the Home Screen design that I had left unfinished yesterday. After finalizing the layout, I worked on designing the Shop Cards, which are the main USP (unique selling point) of the KaamDhanda User app. I focused on making the shop cards clear, attractive, and easy to understand so users can quickly view shop details and take action. This work helped improve the overall usability and visual appeal of the home screen.
