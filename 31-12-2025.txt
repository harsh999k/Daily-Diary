Task: Complete Automated Chat Flow

Work: Today, I completed the Automated Chat flow of the KaamDhanda User app. I created a high-fidelity wireframe to define the proper structure of the chat interface. I designed the conversation flow, message options, and user actions to ensure a smooth and logical chat experience. I also applied appropriate colors according to the brand style to make the chat interface visually clear and engaging. While completing this task, I focused on clarity, usability, and quick responses, so users can easily get the required information without confusion.
