Task: Test the latest Apps (KaamDhanda Partner)

Work: Today, I tested the latest versions of the KaamDhanda Partner (KDP) app and the KaamDhanda User (KD) app. The main focus today was on the KaamDhanda Partner app. This app was bit different. The UX is so complicated even i can't understand. Also there are so much errors in design. but analyze how shopkeeper use this app to showcase his shop online. How they manage their inventory and his resources. This app is so much helpful for those who can't sell their things online.
