Task: Complete the order screen 

Work: Today, I continued working on the KaamDhanda User app design. I refined the Order screen by focusing on usability and user flow. I improved spacing, alignment, and content hierarchy to make the screen clearer and easier to understand. I also added essential UI elements such as buttons, icons, and status indicators to enhance user interaction. Additionally, I included a search bar and filter buttons to support easy navigation and help users find orders more quickly.
