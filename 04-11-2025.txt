Task: Notification screen

Work: Today, I designed the empty (blank) Notification screen of the KaamDhanda User app, which is shown when there are no notifications available. I used friendly text and simple visuals to clearly inform users that there are no updates at the moment. i also add the tabs in the main notification screen to distinguish the notification.
