Task: Study About Wireframing

Work: Today, I studied how wireframing is used to structure the design and layout before moving to the final UI. I learned how wireframes help in planning screen structure, content placement, and user flow in an application. After understanding the concept, I created low-fidelity wireframes to focus on basic layout and high-fidelity wireframes to represent more detailed and refined designs. This activity helped me understand how wireframing makes the design process more clear, organized, and efficient.
