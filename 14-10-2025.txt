Task: Study the UX design process

Work: Today, I studied the UX design and research process in detail. I learned how user research is conducted at different stages of the design process, from understanding user needs to testing and validation. I also learned how research helps in creating effective UX for mobile applications, which makes them stand out compared to other apps. This study helped me understand the importance of data-driven decisions and user-centered design in building better digital products.
