Day: Tuesday

Task: Practice the prototyping and variables

Work: Today, I practiced the features that I learned yesterday related to advanced prototyping in Figma. I created different sample prototypes to understand interactions and animations better. I also studied professional design templates to learn best practices used by experienced designers. Additionally, I learned how to use variables to create a design system, which helps maintain consistency and makes designs easier to manage and update. This practice helped improve my workflow and design efficiency.
