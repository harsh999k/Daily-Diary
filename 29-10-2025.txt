Task: Product detail screen

Work: Today, I continued working on the Product Details screen of the KaamDhanda User app. I converted the wireframes into a more detailed design by adding proper layout structure, images, text sections, and action buttons. I focused on visual hierarchy, readability, and usability so users can easily understand product information and take action. This work helped me refine the product presentation and improve the overall user experience.
