Task: Changing in the home screen 

Work: Today, I made updates to the Home Screen of the KaamDhanda Partner app based on the feedback provided by my mentor. I adjusted layout, spacing, and add features to improve clarity and usability. After that, I started designing the Order Screen of the app, focusing on how shopkeepers can easily view and manage incoming orders. While working on these screens, I focused on usability, clear information flow, and efficient order management.
